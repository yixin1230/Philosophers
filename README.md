# Philosophers

# About the project

A project made in accordance with the philosophers project which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum. It is a version of the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem). One or more philosophers sit at a round table. There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table. Philosophers need two forks to eat the spaghetti. There are as many forks as philosophers. The challenge is to write a program that lets the philosophers dine without starving. Each philosopher is a **thread** and the availability of each fork is protected by a **mutex**.
